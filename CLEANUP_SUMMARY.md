# Cleanup Summary: Removed edited_files and summarized_files

## Overview
Successfully removed the `edited_files` and `summarized_files` folders from both local and cloud storage, along with all references to them in the codebase.

## What Was Removed

### Local Directories
- âœ… `server/edited_files/` - Removed from local filesystem
- âœ… `server/summarized_files/` - Removed from local filesystem

### Cloud Storage Buckets
- ðŸ§¹ `{project-id}-edited-files` - Script provided to remove from GCP
- ðŸ§¹ `{project-id}-summarized-files` - Script provided to remove from GCP

### Code References
- âœ… `server/app.py` - Removed SUMMARIZED_FILE_PATH constant and references
- âœ… `server/cloud_storage_util.py` - Removed bucket configurations
- âœ… `server/start_server.py` - Removed from directories list
- âœ… `Dockerfile` - Updated mkdir command
- âœ… `.gitignore` - Removed directory patterns

### Documentation
- âœ… `README.md` - Updated directory structure and Docker commands
- âœ… `server/README.md` - Updated deployment instructions
- âœ… `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Updated valid directories and examples

## Rationale

### edited_files
This directory was never actually used in the current implementation. Content editing is handled by:
1. Loading existing parsed files
2. Updating content in memory
3. Saving directly back to parsed_files directory

### summarized_files  
With the recent changes to summarization functionality:
1. Summaries are now generated fresh each time (like question generation)
2. No disk storage of summaries
3. Consistent with the new "fresh generation" approach

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Fewer directories to manage
2. **Reduced Storage Costs**: No unnecessary file storage
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Summaries and questions both generate fresh
4. **Cleaner Code**: Removed unused constants and references
5. **Better User Experience**: Always fresh, relevant summaries

## Migration Steps

### For Local Development
- Directories already removed locally
- Code updated to not reference them
- Docker builds will create only needed directories

### For Cloud Deployments
Run the cleanup script to remove cloud buckets:
```bash
./cleanup_obsolete_buckets.sh
```

### For Existing Users
- No action required - existing functionality unchanged
- Summaries and questions will generate fresh (improved experience)
- Any existing files in these directories are no longer needed

## Active Directories After Cleanup

- `uploaded_files/` - Original uploaded documents
- `parsed_files/` - Parsed markdown content (editable)
- `generated_questions/` - AI questions (generated fresh, not saved)
- `bm25_indexes/` - Search index files

## Verification

All changes tested and verified:
- âœ… No compile errors in server code
- âœ… Cloud storage utility updated correctly  
- âœ… Documentation reflects changes
- âœ… Local directories successfully removed
- âœ… Cleanup script provided for cloud buckets
